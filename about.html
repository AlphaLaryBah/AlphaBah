                    <p class="shadow-lg p-2  bg-white rounded text-center"  style="text-indent: 50px;"><strong><em>Alpha Bah</em></strong> is a full- stack software developer who is
                      greatly influenced by his foundational upbringing in Sierra Leone. He spent the first twelve
                      years
                      of
                      his life in West Africa being shaped by the culture from which he originated. Alpha finds
                      joy in
                      the
                      parallels between coding and his childhood. It was in these formative years that Alpha
                      learned to
                      be
                      fluent in multiple languages and nuanced dialects. He did this in order to communicate with
                      his
                      community where language and dialect would change from block to block; infact, it was nearly
                      impossible to speak to someone without using at least three languages. Similarly, within the
                      software
                      development field, it is quite difficult to create a fully functioning application without
                      using
                      numerous languages while understanding the different dialects of each one. He enjoys using
                      Bootstrap,
                      React, Node, Css, Express, and the many libraries of javascript in his work. Alpha's ability
                      to
                      both
                      pick up and to move between languages globally enhances his ease in adapting to changes
                      while
                      navigating this industry.</p>


                    <p class="shadow-lg p-2  bg-white rounded text-center" style="text-indent: 50px;"> Alpha has found his footing in coding through his extensive background in the art world.
                      He
                      draws
                      inspiration from his studio experience in music, drawing, painting, and sculpting, as well
                      as his
                      education in theater. Pulling knowledge from both the arts and software development, Alpha
                      finds
                      it
                      rewarding to engage with both the left and the right brain to remain innovative and
                      sustainable.
                      He
                      thrives in the spheres of creativity and practicality that molding codes evokes from and
                      further
                      cultivates within him. Just like a blank canvas, he starts with a blank screen. Where he
                      once
                      would
                      have sketched the outline, he now moves to the wireframes and HTML. Next Alpha may have
                      layered
                      the
                      shading and colors, just as CSS does for an application. While utilizing Javascript and the
                      back-
                      end
                      languages, he adds functionality; this is where he finds that coding moves beyond what one
                      can
                      achieve
                      with a canvas. The expansiveness of software development and what is possible through this
                      craft
                      continues to inspire Alpha and his work within the field. </p>

                    <p class="shadow-lg p-2  bg-white rounded text-center" style="text-indent: 50px;">On the rare occasion that Alpha is not sitting head first in a computer screen he can be
                      found
                      enjoying some of his other passions. He still loves to unwind while playing the piano after
                      a long
                      day. Alpha has an unquenchable thirst for learning and often moves through piles of books
                      and
                      hours of
                      documentaries devoted to history and culture. He also loves cooking delicious food in the
                      kitchen
                      with
                      his wife of over ten years and getting out into nature as often as he is able.</p>
