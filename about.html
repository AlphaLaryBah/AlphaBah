  <!-- ABOUT ME -->
  <h1 class="aboutHeader ml-5 mb-5 mr-0 d-flex justify-content-center ">What about me?</h1>
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="row">

      <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-4 divWithImg">
        <img class="   imgeDiv" src="images/mepic.jpg" alt="picture of Alpha">

      <div class="media-body col mt-5">
        <p class=""><strong class=" bioName "><em>Alpha Bah</em></strong> is a full- stack software developer who is
          greatly influenced by his foundational upbringing in Sierra Leone. He spent the first twelve years of his life in West Africa being shaped by the culture from which he originated. Alpha finds joy in the parallels between coding and his childhood. It was in these formative years that Alpha learned to
          be fluent in multiple languages and nuanced dialects. He did this in order to communicate with his community where language and dialect would change from block to block; infact, it was nearly impossible to speak to someone without using at least three languages. Similarly, within the software
          development field, it is quite difficult to create a fully functioning application without using numerous languages while understanding the different dialects of each one. He enjoys using
          <span>Bootstrap, React, Redux, Redux-Thunk, Node-js, Css, Express-js, MongoDB, Mongoose </span> and the many libraries of <span>javascript </span> in his work. Alpha's ability to both pick up and to move between languages globally enhances his ease in adapting to changes while navigating this industry.
        </p>

      </div>
      <div class='row'>

        <div class='col'>
          <p class=" "> Alpha has found his footing in coding through his extensive background in the art world. He draws inspiration from his studio experience in music, drawing, painting, and sculpting, as well as his education in theater. Pulling knowledge from both the arts and software development, Alpha
          finds it rewarding to engage with both the left and the right brain to remain innovative and sustainable. He thrives in the spheres of creativity and practicality that molding codes evokes from and further cultivates within him. Just like a blank canvas, he starts with a blank screen. Where he once would
            have sketched the outline, he now moves to the wireframes and HTML. Next Alpha may have layered the shading and colors, just as CSS does for an application. While utilizing Javascript and the back-end languages, he adds functionality; this is where he finds that coding moves beyond what one
            can be achieved with a canvas. The expansiveness of software development and what is possible through this craft continues to inspire Alpha and his work within the field. </p>

          <p class="">On the rare occasion that Alpha is not sitting head first in a computer screen he can be found enjoying some of his other passions. He still loves to unwind while playing the piano after a long day. Alpha has an unquenchable thirst for learning and often moves through piles of books
          and hours of documentaries devoted to history and culture. He also loves cooking delicious food in the kitchen with his wife of over ten years and getting out into nature as often as he is able.</p>
